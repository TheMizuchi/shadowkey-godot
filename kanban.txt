  original is just above and below. Will be omnilight here.
- pause game when in amy menu
- don't play spellcast animation when not enough magicka
- implement aggro disengage (periodically check distance to target)
- implement walking on stairs logic
  (two raycasts, lift up player only if bottom raycast is colliding)
- holding down M1 should repeat use of equipped item

- seperate equipped consumables list from equippped weapon / spell list

THINK ABOUT
- cutscenes / story texts

AFTER EVERYTHING ELSE IS DONE
- third-person view
- multiplayer
- upscale sprites
- sort out duplicated meshes. 
  Currently each instance of a mesh in the level is a different mesh
  this is why levels take so much space on disk

IN PROGRESS
- player stats (health, magicka, fatigue)
- list of all items in Shadowkey and their stats
- successful hit indication (blood sprite)
- inventory system
- picking up items
- equipping items

DONE
- successful hit indication (red mesh override)
- stat regen over time
- all weapon animations
- actions reducing fatigue (jump)
- projectile weapons (bows, crossbows, throwing knives)

UPSTREAM ISSUES
- lighting is messed up, wait for Godot to fix it
  affects the overhead light in Azra
