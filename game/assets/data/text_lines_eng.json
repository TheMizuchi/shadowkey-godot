	"1402": "Hmm... I distinctly remember knowing who I was, but that escapes me now. Who are you?",
	"1403": "How should I know?",
	"1404": "An adventurer.",
	"1405": "The mage nods, 'Shadowkeys can sometimes do that to you. Unlocking specific patterns in shadow is a tricky business.'",
	"1406": "Thanks for the hint.",
	"1407": "You're a Shadowmage?",
	"1408": "That's all for now.",
	"1409": "Shadowmage? That sounds about right.  What more can you tell me about me?",
	"1410": "Only theories, no facts.",
	"1411": "Ah, well, a prudent position I suppose.  Would you be interested in letting me know more about myself, should you discover it?",
	"1412": "Sorry, my plate is full.",
	"1413": "An adventurer? That explains your lack of goblinosity. Well played.",
	"1414": "Can you tell me more about me? I am lacking many of the details.",
	"1415": "So am I.",
	"1416": "Excellent, something we have in common then. Would you be interested in letting me know more about me, should you discover it?",
	"1417": "Sorry, my plate is full.",
	"1418": "The man looks pleased.  He takes a step toward you, gesturing with his left hand.",
	"1419": "His shadow bends to overlap yours.  You feel a jolt through your heels, your jaw tightens.",
	"1420": "You see white spots in front of your eyes. When your vision clears you see the man looking surprised.",
	"1421": "More painful than I remembered.  But we should be able to keep in touch now through umbric connection.",
	"1422": "I ought to umbric your...",
	"1423": "I will be in touch.",
	"1424": "The chest contains two scythe crystals and a set of silver picks.",

	"1458": "Here's an idea. First kill the rotting bastards trying to kill us. Then talk.",
	"1459": "Okay",
	"1460": "They made off with my pack of goods. I tracked some of the blighters to this foul place.",
	"1461": "But Twilight Temple is no place for an honest merchant, or even me.",
	"1462": "You get my pack back and I will give you the best I have got.",
	"1463": "Sorry, Olpac.",
	"1464": "The well-traveled orc merchant appraises you and likes what he sees.",
	"1465": "I was examining that Witch Tree back there, when some goblins beset me in camp.",
	"1466": "No, thanks.",

	"1468": "Still, I am grateful.",
	"1469": "Here are two doses of Ghostflame.",
	"1470": "Anyway, if you could get that pack for me I'll make it worth your while. Here's 250 gold upfront. I'll wait here until you return and will reward you with the rest.",

	"1570": "Captain Nym regards you closely, then nods, 'Clearly you do not serve those who pervert shadow, and you have done them considerable damage.'",

	"1572": "Nym hands you the Star Coif.",
	"1573": "The Chieftain kept a Star Tooth in the chest near him.  If you have all seven now, then you are ready to challenge the last corruption of shadow, the Umbra' Keth in the Crypt of Hearts.",

	"3963": "I wonder who...",
	"3964": "Trothgar is making a fortune! All this new business is trickling down into Azra's Crossing as well. I've never seen this town so prosperous.",
	"3965": "That's great!",
	"3966": "Everyone is talking about some mysterious hero. Do you have any clue as to who it could be?",
	"3967": "Only a guess...",
	"3968": "I hear that Dragonstar is recovering from a war, thanks in no small part to this mysterious hero everyone is talking about.",
	"3969": "I'm glad to see my teleporter came in handy.",
	"3970": "Ah, so that's how...",
	"3971": "Yes, I figured you needed all the help you could get. I wish I could have done more... but it looks like you handled yourself well quite well on your own.",
	"3972": "Thanks to you.",
	"3973": "No, it is I who owes you thanks. You truly are the hero I was hoping you'd be. But, now it is time I continue my own journey. The shadows call me.",
	"3974": "Safe journeys, hero. Until we meet again...",
	"3975": "Until we meet again.",
	"3976": "You've done it! You've put an end to the Shadow of Conflict. I had my doubts about you, but it appears I worried for nothing.",
	"3977": "You saved my life, and for that I will be eternally grateful. In fact, you've saved us all from a horrible fate, and for that you will always be remembered.",
	"3978": "So what's next for our village's very own hero? Are you off to new adventures?",
	"3979": "I am off to explore.",
	"3980": "Sleep sounds good.",
	"3981": "Wouldn't you know it, with the rats and raiders gone from town my business has grown ten fold! Thanks in part to you, of course.",
	"3982": "Some mysterious hero cleared the roads between here and Dragonstar. We were able to send medicine to them just in time to combat the sickness that was spreading.",
	"3983": "I wish I knew who it was, so I could thank them. We all owe that person a debt of gratitude.",
	"3984": "I'm sure they know.",
	"3985": "It feels as if a great burden has been lifted from our shoulders. Dragonstar is prospering, and in return so are we. I have a feeling you've had something to do with it...",
	"3986": "We are grateful to have you back. Thank you for everything you've done for us.",
	"3987": "Hah! I knew you had it in you.",
	"3988": "Had what?",
	"3989": "Oh, stop being so modest. It isn't very becoming. I knew it from the moment we met... I could see it in your eyes. You had the heart of a hero. Apparently I wasn't wrong.",
	"3990": "And what about you?",
	"3991": "What about me? There's nothing to tell.",
	"3992": "Now you're being modest.",
	"3993": "Old Trinket smiles, 'Perhaps. Maybe one day I'll tell you, but, for now let's just celebrate your success. Today, you are the hero. Enjoy it.",
	"3994": "Thanks, Trinket.",
